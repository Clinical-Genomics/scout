# Loading Institutes in Scout

To load a institute into scout use the command `scout load institute`. As mentioned in the user guide an [institute](../user-guide/institutes.md) has to have a unique internal id, this is specified on the command line with `-i/--internal-id`. Also a display name could be used if there is a need for that: specify with `-d/--display-name`. If no display name is chosen it will default to internal id.
Note that internal id is unique.
