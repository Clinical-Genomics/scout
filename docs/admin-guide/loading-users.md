# Loading Scout users

To load a user into scout use the command `scout load user`. A user has to:

- belong to an *institute*
- have a *name*
- have a *email adress*

An example could look like:

```bash
scout load user --institute-id cust000 --user-name "Clark Kent" --user-mail clark@mail.com
```

See `scout load user --help` or the [user guide user section](../user-guide/users.md) for more information.
