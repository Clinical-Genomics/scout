# Loading Scout users

To load a user into scout use the command `scout load user`. A user has to:

- belong to an *institute*
- have a *name*
- have a *email adress*

An example could look like:

```bash
scout load user --institute-id cust000 --user-name "Clark Kent" --user-mail clark@mail.com
```

See `scout load user --help` or the [user guide user section](../user-guide/users.md) for more information.

## Managing users from the web interface

Since **Scout v4.104**, it will be also possible for an **admin user** to add, edit, or remove users directly from the **general Users page** in the web interface.

> ⚠️ Note: This page is accessible via the **top-left dropdown menu on the top bar**. Do not confuse it with the **Users link in the sidebar**, which only lists users for a specific institute.
