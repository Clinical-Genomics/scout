scout.models.event
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Define a document to specify activity events and comments both for variants and
cases.

Events are stored in its own collection

The frontend will use the user + verb + link to display the activity.

The Event model is designed to cover a range of user generated events.

Case:
  - Comments
    - tags, content, (title,) user, timestamp
  - Changed status
    - user, timestamp, delta
    - Auto "active" when first user checks out variants
  - Updated synopsis
    - timestamp, user, content
  - Pinning and unpinning a variant
  - Assignments and un-assignments
  - Sanger sequencing orders
  - Analysis updates ("analysis was rerun 13 days ago")
  - Archivals?

Variant:
  - Comments
  - Sanger sequencing orders
  - Pinning
  - Archivals
