# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected security vulnerabilities to `chiara.rasi [at] scilifelab.se` or `daniel.nilsson [at] scilifelab.se`

We warmly welcome all security feedback. We support the main branch and latest release with hot fixes as needed. Should you find a vulnerability for an older version, obviously please also be in touch, and we will see what we can do, especially if it is one that you know to be deployed in production somewhere.
