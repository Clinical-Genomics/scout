## Contributor Guidelines

### Scout Git branching strategy

Scout development is organized on a flexible Git ["Release Flow"] (https://www.nebbiatech.com/2019/03/15/git-branching-strategies-which-one-should-i-pick/) branching system. Our workflow is similar to the [GitHub Flow system](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), but it differs from it for the fact we don't deploy master to production immediately after a pull request is merged. Instead we plan each new release of the software together with production team at our Facility. Before releasing a new Scout version we create a release branch and a [GitHub Release with a tag](https://github.blog/2013-07-02-release-your-software/). This tag points to the head branch of the repository.

The easiest way to create a pull request to Scout would be to clone the repository and create your own feature branch, based on an updated master branch.

### Pull requests

1. We have included an automatic pull request template to help you defining the proposed changes/fixes and how to test the code.
1. If the pull request add functionality the docs should be updated.
1. Don't forget to update the CHANGELOG.md document.

### Coding standards

Have a look at previous code and try to follow.
Always include docstrings to explain functions/classes.
All code has to work for python versions > 3.6.
